      <description>Welcome to my personal website for all of my research, data, and scripts. I&amp;rsquo;m a Researcher at InSight Crime and a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. My research investigates what can lead to positive peace with a particular focus on reducing criminal violence in postconflict states. I also do work on the effects of peacekeeping on public health, how recruitment strategies affect group behavior, and counterinsurgency policy analysis.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a book designed to take researchers that are already proficient in STATA, and show them how to do the same analyses in R. The hope is that by starting with what the reader already understands and showing how to replicate their code in R, the transition to open source software will be gentle. After covering the basics, the book then moves on to more R specific lessons that may introduce techniques that aren&amp;rsquo;t commonly seen in STATA.</description>

Methods This is a collection of readings and videos that I&amp;rsquo;ve personally found useful for learning Bayesian methods.
Intoduction to Bayesian Methods Statistical Rethinking
by Richard McElreath
I&amp;rsquo;ve found this to be intuitive, without being overly mathy, while still being rigurours and covering a number of useful topics. The author has also made lectures freely availble here.

      <description>UCDP ID translations Packages for R and Python. Translates between the old and new UCDP IDs for actors, conflicts, and dyads.
R
Merging statistics For R. This builds off of the base-R merge() function to provide information about how well the two datasets merged. It adds a variables merge to the dataset with information on each row (similar to the variable _merge in STATA), as well as an output summarizing the merge.</description>
