                                    <p>Welcome to my personal website for all of my research, data, and scripts. I&rsquo;m a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. My research investigates what can lead to positive peace with a particular focus on reducing criminal violence in postconflict states. I also do work regarding the effects of peacekeeping on public health, how recruitment strategies affect group behavior, and counterinsurgency policy analysis. In addition to my substantive interests, I&rsquo;m interested in quantitative methodologies, including bayesian analysis, machine learning, text analysis, quasi-experimental methods, data scraping, and GIS.</p>

                                    <p>I&rsquo;m working on  a book designed to take researchers that are already proficient in STATA, and show them how to do the same analyses in R. The hope is that by starting with what the reader already understands and showing how to replicate their code in R, the transition to open source software will be gentle. After covering the basics, the book then moves on to more R specific lessons that may introduce techniques that aren&rsquo;t commonly seen in STATA.</p>

<h3 id="guatemalas-eroding-freedomsguatemalas-eroding-freedoms"><a href="#guatemala's-eroding-freedoms">Guatemala’s Eroding Freedoms</a></h3>
<p>March 6, <a href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2022-03-06/asi-se-compra-un-estado-como-una-minera-rusa-corrompio-a-todos-los-poderes-en-guatemala.html?ssm=TW_AM_CM">El País published a report</a> on corruption, environmental degradation, and media repression in Guatemala. March 8, <a href="https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/politica/congreso-aprueba-ley-que-penaliza-el-aborto-regula-la-educacion-sexual-y-rechaza-la-diversidad-de-genero-breaking/">the Guatemalan government passed a law</a> criminalizing abortion, limiting sex ed, and banning marriage equality. Instead of protecting Guatemalans from the harm caused by nickel mines, Congress decided to crack down on personal freedoms.</p>
<p>The Law for the Protection of Life and the Family (Ley para la Protección de la Vida y la Familia) defines several norms and penalties. It delineates a family as a man, a woman, and their children, increases the penalties for all abortions, bans gay marriage, and prohibits public and private educators from teaching sexual diversity, “gender ideology,” or anything other than heterosexual sex as normal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/politica/organizaciones-advierten-violaciones-a-derechos-humanos-en-la-aprobacion-de-la-iniciativa-5272/">Organizations have condemned the new law</a>, claiming it will foster discrimination, violence, and intolerance.</p>
<p>Falling on International Women’s Day, the legislation comes just after <a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/">Forbidden Stories</a> revealed the destruction caused by Russian-Swiss mining company Solway. Operating in Guatemala’s Izabal Nature Reserve, Solway has extracted thousands of tonnes of nickel for processing in Ukraine.</p>
<p>More the <a href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2022-03-06/asi-se-compra-un-estado-como-una-minera-rusa-corrompio-a-todos-los-poderes-en-guatemala.html?ssm=TW_AM_CM">60 journalists worldwide examined Solway’s internal communications</a>. They uncovered plans to hide the mine’s environmental damage, skirt the courts, influence indigenous opinion, payoff police, and spread rumors of AIDS in uncooperative communities.</p>
<p>Instead of investigating the corruption and abuse within its borders, the Guatemalan government has gone after Carlos Choc, a Mayan reporter from El Estor. He’s been threatened, had his house broken into and his dog killed; legal charges were brought against him, followed by threats to take him from his children. Choc’s crime? He photographed Carlos Maaz’s corpse lying in the street. Maaz was killed after protesting a mine that turned the waters he fished red, shrinking the catches he and others relied on. The police claimed that they did not kill anyone while breaking up the protest—Choc proved they lied.</p>
<p>Connections to the mine penetrate all levels of the Guatemalan government, from local officials to President Alejandro Giamettei. <a href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2022-03-06/asi-se-compra-un-estado-como-una-minera-rusa-corrompio-a-todos-los-poderes-en-guatemala.html?ssm=TW_AM_CM">El País reported</a> a message from the mine’s director to Giamettei requesting action to end protests in El Estor. Two weeks later, 500 soldiers plus antiriot police arrived to end the resistance.</p>
<p>Instead of standing up for its people, the Guatemalan government has decided to stand up for mining. The effects on the environment are hitting indigenous peoples hardest. The state has demonstrated a consistent apathy towards the very people it is supposed to represent, and now they are further constricting individual freedoms in the name of protecting “the family.”</p>

<p>With Michelle Benson, Colin Tucker, and Chhandosi Roy.
Ghobarah, Huth, and Russett (2003) show that civil wars can continue to cause harm postconflict as the destruction of heath institutions lead to decreased healthy life expectancy. We replicate the initiation results while adding in a measure of peacekeeping to determine whether the presence of a mission can reduce the negative impact of conflict. We then analyze new data with additional years and improved measures. Are initial findings support the idea the peacekeeping can reduce the damaging effects of conflict on health.</p>

<p>With Chhandosi Roy.
We argue that whether or not it is in the strategic interest of a rebel group to target civilians depends on who the civilians are and how the group recruits. Using a novel dataset on rebel recruitment, we test whether how a group select recruit for the population correlates which the amount of one-sided violence a group commits.</p>

<h3 id="airstrikes-and-counterinsurgency">Airstrikes and Counterinsurgency</h3>
<p>With Colin Tucker.
Forthcoming in <em>Security Studies</em>
The policy community has been debating the use of airstrikes for counterinsurgency for years. One side argues that their stealth, ability to hover, smaller payloads, and unmanned flight all combine to make drones an effective counterinsurgency tool. The other side argues that civilian casualties, and the lack of territorial control actually helps groups recruit more members, and is therefor counter productive. Using data from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, we conduct quantitative analysis of these arguments.</p>

<p>These are my attempts at simulating the effects of peacekeeping operations. I&rsquo;m starting simple and building complexity as I go. Currently, <code>app.py</code> is a simulation that looks at the monthly effect of PKO troops on battle-related deaths based on the findings of Hultman, Kathman, &amp; Shannon (2014). It creates a web app using <code>streamlit</code> which allows the user to change the values with sliders.</p>

I test whether the dynamics that lead to increased one-sided violence by rebel groups during a conflict continue to increase violence when the conflict ends.</p>

tour of the development of Bayesian methods, and their successes and
applications is a wide variety of fields. Sharon Bertsch McGrayne does a great
job developing the difference between Bayesian and frequentist definitions of
probability and showing obstacles that kept Bayesian methods from being the
default for so long.</p>
