                                    <p>Welcome to my personal website for all of my research, data, and scripts. I&rsquo;m a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. My research investigates what can lead to positive peace with a particular focus on reducing criminal violence in postconflict states. I also do work regarding the effects of peacekeeping on public health, how recruitment strategies affect group behavior, and counterinsurgency policy analysis. In addition to my substantive interests, I&rsquo;m interested in quantitative methodologies, including bayesian analysis, machine learning, text analysis, quasi-experimental methods, data scraping, and GIS.</p>

                                    <p><em>R for STATA Users</em> is a book designed to take researchers that are already proficient in STATA, and show them how to do the same analyses in R. The hope is that by starting with what the reader already understands and showing how to replicate their code in R, the transition to open source software will be gentle. After covering the basics, the book then moves on to more R specific lessons that may introduce techniques that aren&rsquo;t commonly seen in STATA.</p>

<p>With Michelle Benson, Colin Tucker, and Chhandosi Roy.
Ghobarah, Huth, and Russett (2003) show that civil wars can continue to cause harm postconflict as the destruction of heath institutions lead to decreased healthy life expectancy. We replicate the initiation results while adding in a measure of peacekeeping to determine whether the presence of a mission can reduce the negative impact of conflict. We then analyze new data with additional years and improved measures. Are initial findings support the idea the peacekeeping can reduce the damaging effects of conflict on health.</p>

<p>With Chhandosi Roy.
We argue that whether or not it is in the strategic interest of a rebel group to target civilians depends on who the civilians are and how the group recruits. Using a novel dataset on rebel recruitment, we test whether how a group select recruit for the population correlates which the amount of one-sided violence a group commits.</p>

<h3 id="airstrikes-and-counterinsurgency">Airstrikes and Counterinsurgency</h3>
<p>With Colin Tucker.
The policy community has been debating the use of airstrikes for counterinsurgency for years. One side argues that their stealth, ability to hover, smaller payloads, and unmanned flight all combine to make drones an effective counterinsurgency tool. The other side argues that civilian casualties, and the lack of territorial control actually helps groups recruit more members, and is therefor counter productive. Using data from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, we conduct quantitative analysis of these arguments.</p>

<p>These are my attempts at simulating the effects of peacekeeping operations. I&rsquo;m starting simple and building complexity as I go. Currently, <code>app.py</code> is a simulation that looks at the monthly effect of PKO troops on battle-related deaths based on the findings of Hultman, Kathman, &amp; Shannon (2014). It creates a web app using <code>streamlit</code> which allows the user to change the values with sliders.</p>

<p>The media we consume effects our beliefs, attitude, and actions. Using coverage of the FARC-EP in Colombian newspapers, I see whether the coverage correlates with subnational variation in homicides since the signing of the peace agreement in 2016.</p>

<p>This paper builds off of the organizational explanation for violence against civilians proposed in the book <em>Inside Rebellion: The Politics of Insurgent Violence</em>, by Jeremy Weinstein. I test whether the dynamics that lead to increased one-sided violence by rebel groups during a conflict continue to increase violence when the conflict ends.</p>

<p>Numerous theoretical explanations exist for why criminal and postconflict violence exist. Many have strong statistical evidence and are not direct competitors. Given that there could be multiple causes for increases in homicides in a postconflict state, I use machine learning to predict how much violence is likely due to a given explanation. A null model is first optimized to see the accuracy of generic features. Next, theoretical datasets, with features added based on what a theory proposes is causing violence, are used to see how theory-driven models compare to the null model.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">Statistical Rethinking</a></em></p>
<p>by Richard McElreath</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found this to be intuitive, without being overly mathy, while still
being rigurours and covering a number of useful topics. The author has also
made lectures freely availble <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI">here</a>.</p>

<p>by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill</p>
<p>This book covers just about everything someone doing applied statistics needs to
know, with plenty of examples in R. The author have since updated the first part of the book (see the next book on this list), but the updated second part
isn&rsquo;t out yet.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/">Regression and Other Stories</a></em></p>

<p>The aforementioned update to <em>Data Analysis Using Regression and
Multilevel/Hierarchical Models</em>. I haven&rsquo;t gotten all the way throught this yet,
but so far I&rsquo;m a big fan of how the authors present the informantion and the
visualizations they use. It seems more intuitive to me than the earlier book.</p>

<p>This seems to be the book that&rsquo;s most oriented to those with strong mathematical
backgrounds. The <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf">PDF</a> is availible for non-comercial purposes, and Aki Vehtari has posted

<p>by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne</p>
<p>This book doesn&rsquo;t teach you how to do Bayesian statistics, but it&rsquo;s an excellent
tour of the development of Bayesian methods, and their successes and
applications is a wide variety of fields. Sharon Bertsch McGrayne does a great
job developing the difference between Bayesian and frequentist definitions of
probability and showing obstacles that kept Bayesian methods from being the
default for so long.</p>
