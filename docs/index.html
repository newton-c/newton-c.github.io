                                    <p>Welcome to my personal website for all of my research, data, and scripts. I&rsquo;m a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. My research investigates what can lead to positive peace with a particular focus on reducing criminal violence in postconflict states. I also do work regarding the effects of peacekeeping on public health, how recruitment strategies affect group behavior, and counterinsurgency policy analysis. In addition to my substantive interests, I&rsquo;m interested in quantitative methodologies, including bayesian analysis, machine learning, text analysis, quasi-experimental methods, data scraping, and GIS.</p>

                                    <p>I&rsquo;m working on  a book designed to take researchers that are already proficient in STATA, and show them how to do the same analyses in R. The hope is that by starting with what the reader already understands and showing how to replicate their code in R, the transition to open source software will be gentle. After covering the basics, the book then moves on to more R specific lessons that may introduce techniques that aren&rsquo;t commonly seen in STATA.</p>

<h3 id="guatemalas-eroding-freedomsguatemalas-eroding-freedoms"><a href="#guatemalas-eroding-freedoms">Guatemala’s Eroding Freedoms</a></h3>
<p>March 6, <a href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2022-03-06/asi-se-compra-un-estado-como-una-minera-rusa-corrompio-a-todos-los-poderes-en-guatemala.html?ssm=TW_AM_CM">El País published a report</a> on corruption, environmental degradation, and media repression in Guatemala. March 8, <a href="https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/politica/congreso-aprueba-ley-que-penaliza-el-aborto-regula-la-educacion-sexual-y-rechaza-la-diversidad-de-genero-breaking/">the Guatemalan government passed a law</a> criminalizing abortion, limiting sex ed, and banning marriage equality. Instead of protecting Guatemalans from the harm caused by nickel mines, Congress decided to crack down on personal freedoms.</p>
<p>The Law for the Protection of Life and the Family (Ley para la Protección de la Vida y la Familia) defines several norms and penalties. It delineates a family as a man, a woman, and their children, increases the penalties for all abortions, bans gay marriage, and prohibits public and private educators from teaching sexual diversity, “gender ideology,” or anything other than heterosexual sex as normal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/politica/organizaciones-advierten-violaciones-a-derechos-humanos-en-la-aprobacion-de-la-iniciativa-5272/">Organizations have condemned the new law</a>, claiming it will foster discrimination, violence, and intolerance.</p>
<p>Falling on International Women’s Day, the legislation comes just after <a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/">Forbidden Stories</a> revealed the destruction caused by Russian-Swiss mining company Solway. Operating in Guatemala’s Izabal Nature Reserve, Solway has extracted thousands of tonnes of nickel for processing in Ukraine.</p>
<p>More the <a href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2022-03-06/asi-se-compra-un-estado-como-una-minera-rusa-corrompio-a-todos-los-poderes-en-guatemala.html?ssm=TW_AM_CM">60 journalists worldwide examined Solway’s internal communications</a>. They uncovered plans to hide the mine’s environmental damage, skirt the courts, influence indigenous opinion, payoff police, and spread rumors of AIDS in uncooperative communities.</p>
<p>Instead of investigating the corruption and abuse within its borders, the Guatemalan government has gone after Carlos Choc, a Mayan reporter from El Estor. He’s been threatened, had his house broken into and his dog killed; legal charges were brought against him, followed by threats to take him from his children. Choc’s crime? He photographed Carlos Maaz’s corpse lying in the street. Maaz was killed after protesting a mine that turned the waters he fished red, shrinking the catches he and others relied on. The police claimed that they did not kill anyone while breaking up the protest—Choc proved they lied.</p>
<p>Connections to the mine penetrate all levels of the Guatemalan government, from local officials to President Alejandro Giamettei. <a href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2022-03-06/asi-se-compra-un-estado-como-una-minera-rusa-corrompio-a-todos-los-poderes-en-guatemala.html?ssm=TW_AM_CM">El País reported</a> a message from the mine’s director to Giamettei requesting action to end protests in El Estor. Two weeks later, 500 soldiers plus antiriot police arrived to end the resistance.</p>
<p>Instead of standing up for its people, the Guatemalan government has decided to stand up for mining. The effects on the environment are hitting indigenous peoples hardest. The state has demonstrated a consistent apathy towards the very people it is supposed to represent, and now they are further constricting individual freedoms in the name of protecting “the family.”</p>
<h3 id="who-will-be-colombias-next-presidentwho-will-be-colombia-s-next-president"><a href="#who-will-be-colombia-s-next-president">Who will be Colombia&rsquo;s Next President?</a></h3>
<p>Colombians will head to the polls on May 29th. Eight candidates have made it on the ballot to become Colombia’s next leader; here’s who they are.</p>
<p>The System</p>
<p>The Colombian constitution binds presidents to a single, four-year term, so the incumbent Iván Duque Márquez won’t appear on the ballot.</p>
<p>Presidential elections have two rounds. On May 29th, voters choose from any of the eight candidates; if one receives a majority, they win. If not, a second round will take place between the two candidates with the most votes, June 19th.</p>
<p>Colombia has three major coalitions representing the major candidates: the Historic Pact for Colombia (Pacto Historico por Colombia), the Team for Colombia Coalition (Coalición Equipo por Colombia), and the Hope Center Coalition (Coalición Centro Esperanza) with five others running with smaller parties or as independents.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eltiempo.com/elecciones-2022/presidencia/candidatos-presidenciales-2022-estos-seran-los-10-aspirantes-658228">The Candidates</a></p>
<p>Wining 3 million votes, Gustavo Perto of the Historic Pact for Colombia party <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/colombias-looming-presidential-election-is-set-to-be-historic-1031361612?op=1">received more support</a> than any other candidate during the primaries. The former M-19 militant is an economist and notable figure of the Colombian Left. Previously mayor of Bogotá (2011-13), representative, and senator, Petro made it to the second round of the 2018 presidential election before losing to Duque.</p>
<p>Petro wants to reimagine Colombia’s economy, shifting from extraction of coal and oil, to agriculture and rural development. Critics say that oil is too ingrained in the Colombian economy to be able to reduce extraction without damaging the economy writ large.</p>
<p>Team for Colombia Coalition’s Federico “Fico” Gutiérrez won the second most primary votes with 1.4 million. The civil engineer and former mayor of Medellín (2015-19) was <a href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2022-03-14/fico-gutierrez-y-el-riesgo-de-reconocerse-como-el-candidato-de-uribe.html">endorsed by the Centro Democrático</a>, party of ex-president Álvaro Uribe. Though Gutiérrez has secured a strong coalition on the right, he will need to secure voters from the center to beat Petro in a second round.</p>
<p>Fico is running on a campaign of <a href="https://www.elespectador.com/politica/elecciones-colombia-2022/federico-gutierrez-y-sus-propuestas-presidenciales/">order and opportunities</a>, a broad program aimed at insecurity, corruption, democracy at risk, insufficient growth, low productivity and unemployment, poverty, and inequality. In total, he’s announced 246 proposals and 100 early goals.</p>
<p>Ideologically between Petro and Fico is Sergio Fajardo, candidate of the Hope Center Coalition. Another former mayor of Medellín (2003-07), Fajardo also ran in 2018 but failed to make it to the second round. His campaign has focused on education, women’s rights, and food security, but he’s also discussed policies to promote science and technology.</p>
<p>Moving to the other parties, Oxygen Green nominated Ingrid Betancourt whose 2002 presidential run was interrupted when she was kidnaped by FARC guerillas. Her focus has been on fighting corruption, though the has also advocated for cooperation with bordering Venezuela’s dictator Nicolás Maduro. Armed groups hide across the border in Venezuela while staging attacks in Colombia. Betancourt has stated that dialogue with Maduro is necessary to fight these groups. She is also a proponent of drug decriminalization and investment in Colombia’s rural economies.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Hernández is an independent candidate running an anti-corruption campaign. The civil engineer and former mayor of Bucaramanga (also known as the City of the Parks). He’s said that Colombia’s main problem is <a href="https://www.eltiempo.com/economia/sectores/rodolfo-hernandez-propuestas-economicas-del-candidato-presidencial-658298">taxing the People for the gain of politicians</a>. He wants to reform public spending to invest taxes in agriculture, balancing the budget by cracking down on waste and corruption.</p>
<p>Another independent is Luis Péres Gutiérrez. The civil engineer and mathematician was formerly mayor of Medellín (2001-03) and governor of Antioquia (2014-18). His primary policy aims to reduce the sales tax from 19% to 6% while removing all tax exemptions. He’s also supported legalizing medical and recreational marijuana to transform it into a profitable and taxable industry.</p>
<p>Just and Free Colombia candidate, John Milton Rodríguez was elected to the senate in 2018. An industrial engineer and pastor, his wife and he founded the Peace Function Church in Cali. During the lead-up to the referendum for the peace accords negotiated with the FARC, John Milton Rodríguez was a representative for the “No” campaign.</p>
<p>Finally, Enrique Gómez is running as the National Salvation Movement’s candidate. A lawyer, Enrique Gómez has an extensive political family being the son of journalist and politician Enrique Gómez Hurtado, the grandson of conservative politician Laureano Gómez, and the nephew of conservative politician Álvaro Gómez Hurtado, who was assassinated in 1995.</p>
<p>The Expectations</p>
<p>Gustavo Petro is likely to win the most votes, but fall short of a majority. His opponents are likely to split votes so it’s unclear who will join him in the second round. Fico Gutiérrez is likely to move on if he can gain support from the center, though independent candidate Rodolfo Hernádez has been polling well and may present a challenge. Though Fajardo has the support of a major coalition, a polarized Colombian electorate will likely find him too centrist.</p>
<p>While Petro may finish 1st after the initial round, his detractors are likely to rally behind whoever else makes it to the second round, so it’s unclear who will get the keys to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_de_Nari%C3%B1o">Casa de Nariño</a>.</p>
<p>Leading up to the election, there are concerns about violence.  According to the <a href="https://acleddata.com/#/dashboard">Armed Conflict &amp; Events Data Project</a>, Colombia suffered a <a href="https://acleddata.com/2022/03/25/colombia-legislative-elections/">spike in violence</a> against civilians in the run-up to the congressional elections held earlier this year. As the presidential election draws nearer, it’s possible intimidation will be used to dissuade voters.</p>
<p>The outcome will likely be a referendum on Uribismo. Should Petro, or an independent win, it’s a sign that Colombians are ready to embrace a new style of leadership. Should Fico Gutiérrrez come out on top, Colombia will spend four more years heading down its present route.</p>

<p>With Michelle Benson, Colin Tucker, and Chhandosi Roy.
Ghobarah, Huth, and Russett (2003) show that civil wars can continue to cause harm postconflict as the destruction of heath institutions lead to decreased healthy life expectancy. We replicate the initiation results while adding in a measure of peacekeeping to determine whether the presence of a mission can reduce the negative impact of conflict. We then analyze new data with additional years and improved measures. Are initial findings support the idea the peacekeeping can reduce the damaging effects of conflict on health.</p>

<p>With Chhandosi Roy.
We argue that whether or not it is in the strategic interest of a rebel group to target civilians depends on who the civilians are and how the group recruits. Using a novel dataset on rebel recruitment, we test whether how a group select recruit for the population correlates which the amount of one-sided violence a group commits.</p>

<h3 id="airstrikes-and-counterinsurgency">Airstrikes and Counterinsurgency</h3>
<p>With Colin Tucker.
Forthcoming in <em>Security Studies</em>
The policy community has been debating the use of airstrikes for counterinsurgency for years. One side argues that their stealth, ability to hover, smaller payloads, and unmanned flight all combine to make drones an effective counterinsurgency tool. The other side argues that civilian casualties, and the lack of territorial control actually helps groups recruit more members, and is therefor counter productive. Using data from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, we conduct quantitative analysis of these arguments.</p>

Currently, <code>app.py</code> is a simulation that looks at the monthly effect of PKO troops on battle-related deaths based on the findings of Hultman, Kathman, &amp; Shannon (2014). It creates a web app using <code>streamlit</code> which allows the user to change the values with sliders.</p>
