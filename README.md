Welcome to my personal website for all of my research, data, and scripts. I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. My research investigates what can lead to positive peace with a particular focus on reducing criminal violence in post-conflict states. I also do work regarding the effects of peacekeeping on public health, how recruitment strategies affect group behavior, and counter-terrorism policy analysis. In addition to my substantive interests, I'm interested in quantitative methodologies, including machine learning, text analysis, quasi-experimental methods, data scraping, and GIS.
