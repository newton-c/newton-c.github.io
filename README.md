Welcome to my personal website for all of my research, data, and scripts. I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. My research investigates what can lead to positive peace with a particular focus on reducing criminal violence in postconflict states. I also do work regarding the effects of peacekeeping on public health, how recruitment strategies affect group behavior, and counterinsurgency policy analysis. In addition to my substantive interests, I'm interested in quantitative methodologies, including bayesian analysis, machine learning, text analysis, quasi-experimental methods, data scraping, and GIS.
