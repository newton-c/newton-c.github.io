About this site

My personal website for all of my research, data, and scripts. I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. My research investigates what can lead to positive peace with a particular focus on criminal violence in postconflict states. I also do work on the effects of peacekeeping on public health, how rebel recruitment strategies affect their behavior of the group, and counterterrorism policy analysis. In addition to my substantive interests, I work on quantitative methodogies, inclucing maching learning, text analysis, quasi-experimental methids, data scraping, and GIS.
