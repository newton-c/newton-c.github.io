                        My personal website for all of my research, data, and scripts. I'm currently a 
                        PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University at 
                        Buffalo, SUNY. My research investigates what can lead to positive peace with 
                        a particular focus on criminal violence in postconflict states. I also do 
                        work on the effects of peacekeeping on public health, how rebel recruitment 
                        strategies affect the behavior of the group, and counterterrorism policy 
                        analysis. In addition to my substantive interests, I work on quantitative 
                        methodologies, inclucing maching learning, text analysis, quasi-experimental 
                        methods, data scraping, and GIS.
