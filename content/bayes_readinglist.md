title: Bayesian Readings
---

This is a collection of readings and videos that I've personally found useful
for learning Bayesian methods.

## Intoduction to Bayesian Methods
*[Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)*

by Richard McElreath

I've found this to be intuitive, without being overly mathy, while still
being rigurours and covering a number of useful topics. The author has also
made lectures freely availble [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI).

## More Advanced
*[Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/)*

by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill

This book covers just about everything someone doing applied statistics needs to
know, with plenty of examples in R. The author have since updated the first part of the book (see the next book on this list), but the updated second part
isn't out yet.

*[Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/)*

by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari

The aforementioned update to *Data Analysis Using Regression and
Multilevel/Hierarchical Models*. I haven't gotten all the way throught this yet,
but so far I'm a big fan of how the authors present the informantion and the
visualizations they use. It seems more intuitive to me than the earlier book.

## Even More Advanced
*[Bayesian Data Analysis](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/)*

by Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal Stern, David Dunson, Aki Vehtari,
and Donald Rubin.

This seems to be the book that's most oriented to those with strong mathematical
backgrounds. The [PDF](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf) is availible for non-comercial purposes, and Aki Vehtari has posted
[course material](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto).

## Time-Series Cross-Sectional Data
*[A Bayesian Multilevel Modeling Approach to Time-Series Cross-Sectional Data](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/abs/bayesian-multilevel-modeling-approach-to-timeseries-crosssectional-data/C8345F30FE7CBF04B71ECFC321869D1F)*

by Boris Shor, Joseph Bafumi, Luke Keele, David Park

*Political Analysis*, 2007, Vol.15 (2), p.165-181

*[How Many Countries for Multilevel Modeling? A Comparison of Frequentist and Bayesian Approaches]()*

by Daniel Stegmueller

*American Journal of Political Science*, 2013, Vol.57 (3), p.748-761

## Popular Press
*[The Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayesâ€™ Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy](http://www.mcgrayne.com/the_theory_that_would_not_die__how_bayes__rule_cracked_the_enigma_code__hunted_do_107493.htm)*

by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne

This book doesn't teach you how to do Bayesian statistics, but it's an excellent
tour of the development of Bayesian methods, and their successes and
applications is a wide variety of fields. Sharon Bertsch McGrayne does a great
job developing the difference between Bayesian and frequentist definitions of
probability and showing obstacles that kept Bayesian methods from being the
default for so long.
