### Book Project
- A guide for those already proficient in STATA that would like to make the jump to open source programming using R. The chapters run through statistical techniques, from getting descriptive statistics, to advanced regression methods, and shows how to replicate what people would do in STATA using R. The later chapters adds some additional tricks that maybe new as well.

  > [Python](https://github.com/newton-c/UCDP_ID_translation_python)
- Merge statistics
  - For R. This builds off of the base-R `merge()` function to provide information about how well the two datasets merged. It adds a variables `merge` to the dataset with information on each row (similar to the variable `_merge` in STATA), as well as an output summarizing the merge.
