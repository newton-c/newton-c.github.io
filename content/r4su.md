I'm working on  a book designed to take researchers that are already proficient in STATA, and show them how to do the same analyses in R. The hope is that by starting with what the reader already understands and showing how to replicate their code in R, the transition to open source software will be gentle. After covering the basics, the book then moves on to more R specific lessons that may introduce techniques that aren't commonly seen in STATA.

See the rough start to the book here: [https://newton-c.github.io/Learn_R_from_STATA/](https://newton-c.github.io/Learn_R_from_STATA/)
