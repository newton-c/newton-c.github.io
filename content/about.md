Welcome to my personal website for all of my research, data, and scripts. I'm an Investigator at InSight Crime and a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY. These's days I'm mainly focued on organized crime in Latin America and using data to communicate complex stories. My academic research has focused on what can lead to positive peace with a particular focus on reducing criminal violence in postconflict states. I also do work regarding the effects of peacekeeping on public health, how recruitment strategies affect group behavior, and counterinsurgency policy analysis. In addition to my substantive interests, I'm interested in quantitative methodologies, including bayesian analysis, machine learning, text analysis, quasi-experimental methods, data scraping, and GIS, and leaening languages. I'm fluent in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English and ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¾ Spanish, my ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French is decent, and I'm learning ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Portuguese.
